<h1 id="flask-docker-pwd">flask docker pwd</h1>
<p>This is a small example to show how a flask app in a docker container can interact with the host filesystem in a <em>very</em> unsafe way.</p>
<h2 id="build">build</h2>
<p>To build the docker image, clone this repository then in the same dir as the Dockerfile run the following:</p>
<p><code>docker build -t odf/flask-docker-pwd .</code></p>
<p>The “odf/flask-docker-pwd” part is just a name and can be anyting you want. Also note the “.” at the end of the command.</p>
<h2 id="running">running</h2>
<p>Once the image is built run it with the following:</p>
<p><code>docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/context -p 5000:5000 odf/flask-docker-pwd</code></p>
<p>The <code>-it</code> part is “interactive tty”, this is so you can <kbd>control c</kbd> to kill the server. The <code>--rm</code> flag is so docker cleans up the stateless container after you end the process. The <code>-v $(pwd):/context</code> maps the current working directory to the <code>/context</code> mount point <em>inside</em> the container. The <code>$(pwd)</code> could also be some other path on the host system as long as docker has access to it. The <code>-p 5000:5000</code> part maps port 5000 on the host to 5000 in the container. This is so you can access the flask server in the container by going to http://localhost:5000. The syntax is <code>-p host_port:container_port</code>. Finally, the <code>odf/flask-docker-pwd</code> is whatever you named the image in the build step above.</p>
<h2 id="using">using</h2>
<p>Once the container is running, you should be able to go to http://localhost:5000 and see a list of files in the directory that was mapped into the container. Clicking on any of the file names will bring you to a new page which runs an <code>os.stat</code> on the file and tells you how large it is in bytes (just to prove it is doing something).</p>

<p>This repo also has a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers">VS Code devcontainer definition</a> if you open this repository in VS Code and you have the remote containers extension installed, it might ask if you want to reopen this repository in a container. This is fine if you want to see how that works, but the dev container does not have any <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/docker-in-docker">docker in docker</a> configured, so avoid opening in a container if you just want to build and run.</p>
